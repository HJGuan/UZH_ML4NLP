Lab Report


In this project, we are asked to creat our own word-embedding using the Continuous-Bag-of-Word(CBOW) model based on two corpuses(hotel reviews and a scifi story) and test our embedding. We have build a CBOW2 model and make the hotel reviews dataset and the scifi text embeded in (Part1), and test the embedding (Part2).
