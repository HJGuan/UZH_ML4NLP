#Report for Exercise 1

**
In this exercise, we build a pipline to implement language identification with linear classification(Part1), and Multilayer Perceptron(Part2). We firstly clean, augment and 
preprocess the data. Secondly, feature engineering is completed and the features are fit to SGDClassifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes model. Then we use the GridSearchCV

**Solution**
