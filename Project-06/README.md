# Project 6 Topic Modeling

## Part 1 - Topic Modelling using LDA

**1.1 For each time-period assign a name to each generated topic based on the topic’s top words. List all topic names
in your report.**

**Period 1: before 1990 **

**Period 2: from 1990 to 2009**

**Period 1: from 2009**

**1.2 Do the topics make sense to you? Are they coherent? Do you observe trends? Discuss in 4-6 sentences**



=> We can see that the model being fine tuned using 3000 sentences with non frozen base model parameters achieves the best performance.


## Part 2 - Resource Limited Competition: Sentiment Analysis


**2.1  Assign a name to each topic based on the topic’s top words (for each time-period). List all topic names in
your report.**

**Period 1: before 1990 **

**2.2 Bianchi et al. 2021 claim that their approach produces more coherent topics than previous methods. Let’s test
this claim by comparing the coherence of the topics produced by CTM with the topics produced by LDA. Describe
your observations in 2-4 sentences.**


**2.3 Do the two models generate similar topics? Can you discover the same temporal trends (if there are any)?
Discuss in 4-6 sentences.**
